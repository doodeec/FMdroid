##Description
This is android demo (code sample) which implements simple file browser for android smartphone.

It has a few TODO's, since it's just a code sample, but base principle is functional - application
starts by opening root folder of external storage. User is able to navigate through folders
by clicking on them.

Clicking on single files will result in opening an intent - therefore file can be opened in default
application to browse it.

Long tap on any file will trigger selection mode - multiple selected files can be then deleted at once.

It provides refresh folder functionality and "base folder" setting draft (picking the base folder not
functional - one of TODOs :) )
